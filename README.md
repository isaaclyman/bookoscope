# Bookoscope

#### BOOKOSCOPE IS:

A unified, searchable, visual, book-first catalog for all your OPDS endpoints.

#### WHY?

Some ereader apps can connect to OPDS endpoints, but the functionality is tucked away and awkward. There's no way to browse and search all the ebooks you have access to, all at once.

Bookoscope fills that very small, very important niche.

#### SELLING POINTS:

- Fast
- Easy on the eyes
- Uses cached feeds (refresh on demand)
- Searchable by any available metadata
- Quick download and export to the ereader of your choice

#### BOOKOSCOPE IS *NOT:*

- An ebook reader, sync client, or annotator, like Apple Books, Google Books or Kindle.
- A metadata editor or organizer, like Calibre.
- A self-hosted ebook server, like Kavita or calibre-web.
- A pirating tool.

You can use Bookoscope to enhance an e-reading experience that includes any or all of the above. However, Bookoscope does not endorse, affiliate with, or integrate with any other app or tool.
